    q: "What is a Kundali or Janma Kundli?",
    a: `A Kundli or Janmapatri consists of essential details about an individual. This unique kundali chart in Astrology consists of elements regarding the placement of celestial bodies like the planets and constellations or Nakshatras. An accurate Kundali is made after analysing all these aspects. Janam Kundali predictions are based on various aspects of the Kundali, including the Houses, the placement of Nakshatras, the influence of planets, and the Rashis. Each element has its distinct role, and varied combinations of planets and constellations affect individuals differently. Astrologers create astrology kundli by thoroughly reading the crucial aspects of a person's birth details, such as their date, time and place of birth, and the position of planets and Nakshatras when they were born. For example, favourable combinations of planets in your Janm Kundali will result in promising results. Unfavourable conjunctions of planets will result in inauspicious results. However, in modern times, there are also free kundli software that can help you get your Kundli in a fraction of second.

    q: "What are the different types of Janam Kundali?",
    a: `In a Hindu Kundali, there are nine planets, twelve Houses, and twelve astrological signs or Rashis. While these elements are constant, various systems of Kundli by date of birth are followed in India.
  
  Here are the three types of Janma Kundli by date of birth:
  
  North Indian System
  The North Indian System of birth Kundali believes that the Houses in a Kundli are constant or fixed. This means that the Twelve Houses do not change their positions. However, the astrological signs of Rashis change depending on the Rising Ascendant Sign or Lagna. Therefore, the Lagna or Rising Ascendant is present in the First House in a Janm Kundli, and all other Rashis are positioned according to their order in the Zodiac. Also, Astrological signs are present on the left-hand side of the Kundli.
  
  South Indian System
  Unlike the North Indian System of Kundali, the South Indian System of birth Kundali or birth chart, believes that the Astrological signs are constant. In this, the Houses keep changing their positions, and the Ascendant can be placed anywhere in the Janam Kundali. The House in which the Lagna is present is dissected into parts with two diagonal lines. Astrological Houses are present on the right side of the Ascendant, and the number of signs is not mentioned in the Kundali.
  
  East Indian System
  Lastly, the East Indian System of Janam Kundli, by date of birth and time, is a mix of both the North Indian System and the South Indian System of Janam Kundali by date of birth. However, the look of the East Indian Kundali is entirely different from the Kundli prepared by the former two systems.
  
  While the Astrological Signs are fixed in this system of Kundali like the South Indian System, the Signs are written from the left-hand side like the North Indian System. Also, the Houses change according to the Ascendant.`,
