      info: "The Brahmi script is one of the oldest writing systems in the Indian subcontinent, dating back to the 3rd century BCE. It was primarily used to write various Prakrit languages as well as Sanskrit. The script is named after the Brahmi dynasty, which was associated with its early usage. The Brahmi script was influential in the development of many writing systems in Asia, including modern scripts used in India, Sri Lanka, Southeast Asia, and Tibet.",
      detail:"The Brahmi script consists of a set of phonetic signs or characters, each representing a specific sound or combination of sounds. The characters are written from left to right in a linear fashion, with each character representing a syllable. Over time, the script evolved into regional variations and gave rise to various scripts, such as Devanagari, Tamil, Telugu, Bengali, Gujarati, and many others.",

        "brahmi & astro":"The Brahmi script, an ancient Indian writing system, played a significant role in the field of astronomy in several ways",

 "Astronomical Texts": "Brahmi was used to write various astronomical texts in ancient India. These texts contained valuable knowledge about celestial bodies, their movements, and astronomical calculations. The script facilitated the preservation and transmission of this astronomical knowledge from one generation to another.",
 "Astronomical Observations": "Brahmi was employed to record astronomical observations and findings. Ancient Indian astronomers meticulously recorded their observations of celestial events such as eclipses, planetary positions, and comets. These observations were often inscribed on stone inscriptions or in manuscripts using the Brahmi script. These records allowed astronomers to track and analyze the patterns and behavior of celestial bodies over time.",
 "Astronomical Instruments": "Brahmi was used to label and identify various astronomical instruments. Instruments such as astrolabes, gnomons, and celestial globes were used by ancient Indian astronomers to measure angles, determine time, and make celestial observations. The Brahmi script helped in labeling these instruments and documenting their usage and purpose.",
 "Calculation and Mathematical Notations": "The Brahmi script was employed to represent numerical values and mathematical notations in ancient Indian astronomy. Mathematical calculations were integral to understanding and predicting celestial events. The use of Brahmi script facilitated the representation of numbers, mathematical symbols, and equations, allowing astronomers to perform complex calculations and formulate astronomical theories.",
 "Textual Commentaries": "Brahmi was utilized to write commentaries and explanations on existing astronomical texts. Scholars and astronomers would write detailed commentaries, interpretations, and elaborations on earlier astronomical works. These commentaries provided further insights, clarifications, and expansions on astronomical concepts, making the knowledge more accessible and comprehensible to subsequent generations.",

notes:"The use of the Brahmi script in astronomy enabled the documentation, transmission, and advancement of astronomical knowledge in ancient India. It fostered the accumulation of observations, theories, and calculations, allowing astronomers to make significant contributions to the understanding of celestial phenomena. By utilizing the script, astronomers were able to preserve and disseminate their findings, facilitating the progress of astronomy as a scientific discipline."

      label: "Prakrut Script",
      info: "Prakrut is a term used to refer to a group of ancient and medieval Indo-Aryan languages derived from Sanskrit. These languages were commonly spoken in various regions of India during different historical periods. The Prakrut script is specifically associated with writing these Prakrit languages.",

      detail:"The Prakrut script is a derivative of the Brahmi script and shares many similarities with it. However, it has some unique characteristics that distinguish it from other Brahmi-derived scripts. The script was primarily used to write Jain and Buddhist religious texts, as well as secular literature. Prakrut scripts were prevalent in regions such as Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu.",
    },
  ],
  notes:"The Prakrut script, like Brahmi, is an alphasyllabary, where each character represents a syllable. It is written from left to right, and the individual characters have specific shapes and forms. Some Prakrut scripts, such as Maharashtri and Jain Nagari, bear similarities to Devanagari, the script used to write Sanskrit and several modern Indian languages.",
  remark:"It's important to note that the usage of both Brahmi and Prakrut scripts has declined significantly over the centuries, and they are no longer widely used in their original forms. However, their historical and cultural significance remains, and they continue to be studied and preserved for their linguistic and archaeological value.",
